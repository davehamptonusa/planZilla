starting from Version 0.1.8
0.2.3
Added auto sort by priority and then severirty
added population of image by putting an image url in the url field

0.2.2:
Added mouseover the assigned name to see reporter and QA
Added Icons to clarify Issue Type
Cleaned up Search button images and look at top of page

0.2.1:
This has been reworked to work with the new bugzilla release.  First, it
always changes the way the page looks, because I didn't like the default.

Second, To planZilla-ize a page, click the valueclick logo at the top, as
opposed to the icon that used to be on the side.  You can still reclick to
update and keep your project collapse settings.

To make this work better for you, All Tickets should be assigned to a project
and a release.  Master Project tickets should only be assigned to a release.
Some mouse over info has changed.

The system does not scan past the first release it finds, but the issue type
must be set to "RELEASE" for it to find them.  The old way of using PRD
Complete in the Target Milestone is now defunct.

During the Bugzilla transfer, duplicate release tickets may have been created
that will mess up your system.  You need to make sure that Release tickets
aren't assigned to other release tickets or you're screwed.

0.1.9:
FIXED the Display of comments in switching the to monospace so that it would
wrap properly.

0.1.8:
ADDED initial ability to see and click through attachements.  Still Needs
refinement
FIXED: Display of comments to monospace and preserving spaces so it displays
cut 'n paste tables better
