starting from Version 0.1.8
0.3.5
This is just a test release and works only with search right now tied to our
qa branch for continuous integration.  Just fill out the status notes field
with the test name(s) comma sepparated - and it will create links to the
hudson qa instance for testing
0.3.4
Release and sprint names are auto scrubbed to remove anything prior to \d{4}
You can now save profiles of different products.  Its not pretty, but it
works.
dwirenga has made SPRINTS an issue type available to all products, so you no
longer need to have him create that for you.
minor bug fixes

0.3.3
So now you can set the environment instead of being  forced to use Search123.
The product manager should set tickets in bz that hold all the sprints and
releases.  When they make those a shared search, the user needs to get the
sharer id and the save name and input them in the appropriate field.

Also, you can now click on the type icon (the one on the far left) to pull up
the buigzilla dependecy graph.

Plus, the somewhat loud background has been toned down alot.  Not that I like
this.  But I get the point.

0.3.2
Now you can scan forward in the sprint view and see if there is space
available in future sprints.  The estimated hours for the sprint itself
refresh on the "refresh sprints button in the initial selection screen"

0.3.0
Added ability to handle sprints as well as releases and display both.  You can
search by either a release or a sprint.  It remembers past browser sessioons
your status of what your last search was.
right now you force refresh the release and sprint list - later it will auto
handle this as well (keeping a count)

This is now fairly broken for people outside of search until they have their
bugzilla updated and I add the ability to alter the field designating the
sharerid.

0.2.3
Added auto sort by priority and then severirty
added population of image by putting an image url in the url field

0.2.2:
Added mouseover the assigned name to see reporter and QA
Added Icons to clarify Issue Type
Cleaned up Search button images and look at top of page

0.2.1:
This has been reworked to work with the new bugzilla release.  First, it
always changes the way the page looks, because I didn't like the default.

Second, To planZilla-ize a page, click the valueclick logo at the top, as
opposed to the icon that used to be on the side.  You can still reclick to
update and keep your project collapse settings.

To make this work better for you, All Tickets should be assigned to a project
and a release.  Master Project tickets should only be assigned to a release.
Some mouse over info has changed.

The system does not scan past the first release it finds, but the issue type
must be set to "RELEASE" for it to find them.  The old way of using PRD
Complete in the Target Milestone is now defunct.

During the Bugzilla transfer, duplicate release tickets may have been created
that will mess up your system.  You need to make sure that Release tickets
aren't assigned to other release tickets or you're screwed.

0.1.9:
FIXED the Display of comments in switching the to monospace so that it would
wrap properly.

0.1.8:
ADDED initial ability to see and click through attachements.  Still Needs
refinement
FIXED: Display of comments to monospace and preserving spaces so it displays
cut 'n paste tables better
