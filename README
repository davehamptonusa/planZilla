This is an Add on for bugzilla used primarily by Search123, so it is coded for our use.

For the best benefit, do things our way.  We drink our own kool-aid, so we think our way is best anyways...

To use:

Drag and drop the .crx file into Google Chrome and install as a plug in.

Click on the planZilla Icon to activate

Use Issue Type = 'RELEASE' as the flag for a release tickets.  Dependency sniffinf doesn't go past the first found release ticket.
right click on a ticket with dependencies to close
click on comments or attachment Icons to view in the main screen
It's all "ajaxy" so everything is already on the page and it loads fast.

It's best to open tickets in a new tab and keep your planZilla window open.  That way you can refresh it by clicking the icon again and it will remember what you had collapsed before.

Suggestions?  I probably don't care, but you can email dhampton@valueclick.com and let me know.
Want to share with someone else?  Just send them the .crx or point them to the public folder where I keep it.  I maintain a distribution list, so forward me your name or their name of they want to be on the list to get notification of updates.

Disclaimers:
I wrote it for my own use.  It has bugs.  Deal with it.  Write your own if you want it better or faster.
No it doesn't run in ie or firefox.
